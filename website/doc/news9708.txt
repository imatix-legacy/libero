 == COMMENT ---...-.-...-.--...-.--...-.-...-.....---..-....--.--..-.-.---.--

    Scientific American wrote recently that the computer industry in its
    short history had made no significant contribution to the productivity
    of its customers.  We went from DOS to Windows to the Internet for
    nothing.  All those hours perfecting and tuning our double-clicks were
    wasted.  This is no news to anyone who watched people hammering out
    documents using Word Perfect 5.1 for DOS.  I could never learn this
    product, yet millions of people did, and loved it.  What surprise, then,
    that moving to Word for Windows did not make them work any faster.  They
    could already produce at top speed.

    What applies to our customers applies to us as well.  Are we really
    going to produce better software faster because we throw away everything
    we know and start from scratch every few years - only several gigabytes
    and many bucks poorer?

    In my work as a technical consultant for large firms, I've seen many
    teams working on large and small projects.  Sometimes they had no tools,
    and invented stuff along the way.  Bad choice - developers can't often
    build tools.  Sometimes they chose tools, and paid the price of the
    learning curve.  Sometimes tools were imposed.

    The teams that prospered, that got the work done on time and under
    budget were those who - apart from getting the human aspects right - had
    good tools, and were at the top of the learning curve.  It's a wonder to
    watch such a team develop and produce a solution that works right the
    first time.  It's also the exception, rather than the rule.

    What's the rule?  Tools thrown together by people who can't recognise
    the general from the specific; tools that take six months to get into
    shape and two years to master; tools that throw-up unexpected problems
    well into the middle of a project; tools that build walls rather than
    open doors.  I could go on, and probably will, after a glass of wine
    sometime.

    Okay, I'm coming to the point.  It's admirable to improve things.  But
    just as a social revolution that kills all the intellectuals kills the
    society, a technical revolution that is measured in chopped heads is a
    step backwards.  Progress must recognise that the best is not to come,
    but already exists, and must be reused.  All we can do is tweak, tune,
    and reapply.

    Many of the fundamental problems in making and using software have been
    understood.  Read a book like Steve McConnell's 'Code Complete' from
    Microsoft Press and you'll see what I mean.  Sadly, many people would
    prefer to invent yet one more layer of complexity rather than get down
    to doing the boring work.  The proof is in the pudding, as my Mum used
    to (probably still does) say.  If we're so smart, how come we still
    can't deliver any measurable gains in productivity to ourselves and our
    clients?

    iMatix's success is based on this simple principle: master the
    technology.  We leave nothing to chance, and we waste nothing that's
    worth reusing.  Libero is the application of a technique developed
    thirty years ago.  Okay, we stretched it somewhat, but Peter Naur would
    recognise it and be producing great code in a few hours.

    I predict that in 30 years' time, someone will still be using Libero to
    develop programs, profitably and successfully.  And that's productivity.

    BULGARIAN CONAGENT SHOCK PROBE!
        Does Windows 95 OSR2 really have code saying 'If Xitami AND Bulgaria
        THEN do nothing"?  Even paranoiacs have enemies!  The full shocking
        story on page 1.  (Yes, thanks to the miracle of e-mail and HTML, all
        pages are equal, though some are more equal than others.)

    IMATIX WEBSITE HITS 2GIGS!
        Get your free webservers before the rush hits!  In July, the
        www.imatix.com site served up 2.001 Gigabytes of data to over 75
        countries.  We're stunned, actually.  Hmmm.  We counted some 7500
        downloads of various packages.  Happy to say, only about one in ten
        people actually send us an e-mail, and only about one in fifty have
        some kind of bug report or question.  To spread the load a little we
        are starting to build a network of mirror sites.  If you'd like to
        help, drop us a line!

    FOUR AND A HALF COWS... IT'S NOT ENOUGH SAYS PIETER!
        Our chief egghead, also known as "That Bloody Perfectionist",
        addressed the iMatix HQ research staff this week and said that "Four
        and a half cows are simply not enough!  We want SIX!"  When we know
        what he meant, we'll let you know.  Promised.

    ... this was the first innocent enquiry into what would later be known
    as the 'Bulgarian Conagent Massacre Mystery'.  Why should a CGI program
    not work under Win95 OSR2?  And only in Bulgaria?  Works perfectly well
    here in downtown Antwerpen!  After more than a month of detective work,
    sweaty e-mails, and dark ceremonies at iMatix HQ under the full moon
    involving decapitated squorns, udderwort, tongue of snart and virgin
    frogs, it was Emil who (having not participated in these debugging
    rituals, and thus still awake during the day) finally figured-out what
    was going on:

    >Now I almost know what's going on.  To cut the long story short:
    >I am from Bulgaria; We write with Cyrillic letters, as the Russians do
    >(but the alphabet is invented by Bulgarians!)  This has been causing us
    >many problems with computer codepages, keyboards and fonts.  Especially
    >the DOS codepage we use has never been approved by Microsoft, they
    >still think that we use CP855, while in fact we use a codepage very
    >similar (but not exactly like) the Russian CP867.  So I have made up
    >several files and changed some registry keys in order to be able to
    >use my DOS codepage with Win95.  It worked very well with my first
    >release of Win95, but that was Pan-European.  The OSR2 I have is not
    >Pan-European, and still it seems to work OK except for those 32-bit
    >console applications.
    >
    >For your information, console applications [this includes CGI programs]
    >are started by Win95 with the help of a small program, called
    >conagent.exe, which resides in the windows/system directory.  When in
    >Win95 you try to start a 32-bit application (console or GUI) from a
    >command prompt either directly or with the START command, Windows
    >actually does something inside itself and then starts conagent.exe with
    >a specific command line parameter...  If it is started with any other
    >parameter, conagent.exe just says "This program may only be started by
    >Microsoft Windows" and exits.  That specific parameter is just one
    >byte, and it is different between the two versions I have.  It is 08h
    >in the Pan-European original release, and 098h in the OSR2

    Emil continues:

    >Anyway, in our DOS codepage 098h is a capital letter.  And as such it
    >is subject to OEM-to-ANSI translation.  There is a line oemansi.bin= in
    >the [Keyboard] section of the System.Ini file which should point to a
    >translation table file for OEM-to-ANSI and vice versa translation.
    >That was there in Windows 3, and it is still there in Windows 95,
    >though only 16-bit applications use it now.  What I did was change the
    >mapping only for this specific character 098h to no-mapping and - IT
    >WORKED!
    >
    >ANSI 098h is not a letter, so it doesn't actually matter whether you
    >translate it or not.  This makes it possible to go around the problem
    >by simply changing that single byte (at offset 3Ch in the corresponding
    >XLATnnn.BIN file) from whatever it is to 98h.  And reboot the system,
    >of course.  That's final.
    >
    >And of course I don't mind you using my letters and my name, as long as
    >it is made clear enough what the problem was in fact, because I don't
    >like people truly believing that computers may be haunted by evil
    >spirits.  Computers can't, but it seems to me that programs can...
    >Bye
