 == COMMENT ---...-.-...-.--...-.--...-.-...-.....---..-....--.--..-.-.---.--

    At the start of November, a document was leaked from Microsoft.  This
    document, now called the "Halloween Document", ended-up in the capable
    hands of Eric Raymond, the High Priest of the Open Source Movement.

    If you did not already look at this, it's on the Open Source website at
    www.opensource.org/halloween.html.  It makes an interesting read.
    
    The essence of this document is that Linux represents a movement that is
    a serious danger to Microsoft's hegemony over the software business.
    The process which produced Linux is better, faster, and more capable
    than the software development process inside Microsoft.  The document
    looks at this process (now called 'Open Source Software'), and notes
    that since it is heavily based on open protocols, a good way to break
    the process is to take open protocols and to turn them into protocols
    that only Microsoft can understand and use.
    
    That Microsoft works actively against open standards is not news, nor is
    it a tactic that they invented.  Standards have always been anathema to
    market leaders, since they make competition easier.  But Microsoft take
    the strategy of standards breaking further than anyone ever dared.  The
    remarkable thing about the Halloween Document is that it shows that this
    strategy at least partly directed by policy, although I'd not rule-out
    plain incompetence.

    In my role as a technical consultant, I sometimes get to watch the pain
    people go through when they try to upgrade part of a network that
    depends heavily on MS software.  In one case I recently saw, a web site
    was crashing regularly.  The cure: an upgrade from IIS3 to IIS4.  The
    cost: upgrading the NT server software on over fifteen servers.  The
    remote administration tools only work if all the servers are running the
    same release and service-pack level of NT.

    A Microsoft-only world is pretty unpleasant when you look at it close
    up.  Complex, expensive, and hamstrung by delicate interdependencies.

    The Open Source Software movement (which iMatix is proud to be part of)
    is no longer a bunch of long-haired radicals espousing strange notions
    about how to produce software.  Suddenly we're a bunch of long-haired
    radicals who have just become Bill Gate's worst dream.

 == BITS AND PIECES -..-.-.---.-..----...-.-...-..----..-..-----.-.-.---..--.

     *  In the Halloween Document, we read that Apache has 80,000 lines of
        code.  Xitami (including SFL and SMT) has 95,000 lines of code.  I
        guess we use really short lines.

     *  Libero has been re-released with two new schemas: one for PHP/3, by
        Attilio <glen@ats.it>, and one for PL/SQL, by Sema Group Belgium.
        You can get it from www.imatix.com, as usual: download the Libero
        source package.

     *  Watch next month's Liberetto for an announcement about GSL, the new
        language from iMatix specifically targeted at code generation from
        XML data files.  GSL is like a meta-Libero language, and the next
        generation of Libero will be implemented using GSL.  We'll be making
        more information, as well as free versions of the GSL tools available
        in January 1999.  This issue of Liberetto has a small introduction
        to GSL and XML-based code generation.

     *  Also coming in 1999: www.xitami.com - a web site dedicated to the
        best web server in the world (biased, us?)

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Thanks for once again emitting amusing peeps on controversial subjects.
    It brightens my day no end.

    In Liberetto III/11 you state:
        Microsoft will start by ignoring Linux, and then when Linux has
        30% of the market, they will denounce it.  Eventually, they will
        incorporate Linux into their product range, and then try to take
        it over.  Imagine a MS Linux distribution.  It will happen.  Maybe
        it already exists...

    However, you seem to have missed the phase where Microsoft goes into a
    'benign' partnership with the creators of Linux, gets hold of the source
    code, rewrites it and calls it something else. Their history is peppered
    with the wreckage of companies whose directors thought a partnership was
    the sure road to riches. These comments might be inflammatory if not for
    the court cases still in progress, in which such acts are being judged
    against the better good.

    As for Java, JDK 1.2 Release Candidate 1 contains so much corporate guff
    that the little programmer can't afford a HDD big enough to hold it.
    85Mb of documentation, for crying out loud. I could do without CORBA,
    SQL, JDBC, Security API and a whole bunch of other stuff, thanks. With
    the internet still barely supporting 1.0.2 (and they're usually a jump
    ahead of the rest of the world), I don't see the relevance of a new set
    of API's that has grown by 3x since Java 1.1 was released 18 months
    back.

    If Sun made the extant package work properly and built an optional
    "business pack" that integrated the new stuff by installing over the top
    of JDK 1.1, maybe I could make sense of them. Seems like a distinct lack
    of internal guidance to me; perhaps the company should require her
    employees to occasionally re-read the original White Paper, complete
    with Antoine de Saint Exuperey quotes about perfection being when
    nothing more can be removed rather than when nothing more can be added,
    and talk to James Gosling about what he originally conceived as being an
    efficient language.

    Of course I NEVER lose sight of my goals, and it will all be different
    when WE rule the world, eh my friend. Yeah, sure.

    Regards,
    Rob

    >>>>>>>>>>>>>
    Goals are made to be shifted.  In praise of Antoine de Saint Exuperey,
    we're going to produce a new release of Xitami, 'Xitami/Lite', which
    does nothing else except crash the system at random moments during the
    day, thus fulfilling one of the main functions of modern software at a
    fraction of the effort.  Revolutionary, possibly.

    I just wanted to add something to your "cause of rise in rate of

    hex you read in a chain letter, but it's true: a fellow I know has been
    running a server for years, and he hasn't installed Xitami; he didn't
    get tenure this year. Another fellow I know didn't win the SuperLotto,
    even though he bought 6 tickets; he doesn't even know what Xitami is
    _for_. ... frightening, if you extrapolate ... *sigh* ... such a

    Java here.

    I'm trying to use Libero to generate C++ files - the output file are
    <filename>.cpp .  My unix system assumes that C++ source files are
    <filename>.C  I copied lrschema.cpp to lrschema.C, hoping to fix this,
    but now it dumps out files as <filename>.c .  Is there any way to get
    libero to output <filename>.C ?

    >>>>>>>>>>>>>
    Each Libero schema is in fact a script that tells Libero how to generate
    its code for a particular language.  In the C++ schema, for instance,
    you'll see a line ':output $source.cpp' which creates a file with the
    .cpp extension.  Change this to say ':output $source.c', and your files
    will be given the .c extension.  It can be useful to play with the
    Libero schemas, to tune them and extend them for your own needs, but
    it's best to call your new schemas something different, just to avoid
    problems if you ever upgrade to a new release of Libero.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    you don't know me, but in the last few hours, i've seen too many
    connections to feel i've gotta just say "hi".

    this evening, i just happened onto a website which was rating "hot"
    new web servers - and i saw one listed under apache which i had never
    seen before: xitami. (http://serverwatch.internet.com/top10.html)

    so i downloaded and compiled it on my IRIX box.  it installed and ran
    witout a hitch.  so i started reading the docs... and my mind twisted
    inside out..

    in the very early 90's i was stuck in a DOS programming job, and was in
    need of a multi-tasking environment in which to  develop some projects
    (i was hoping to write an event-driven  DOS/X11-portable windowing
    environment - sick! (but i did it!)) and so i found (through archie,
    no doubt) what appears to be the multi-tasking project mentioned in
    the xitami docs.

    i tweaked it a bit and was able to have nested graphical cubes spinning
    inside each other - each cube in its own pre-empted sub-routine. it was
    cool, but that was about all i did with it. but some part of my brain
    remembered a "Pieter" being tied to it.

    reading the xitami/libero docs, one can see how this early DOS multi
    tasking envinment could permute and grow to be what i just downloaded
    onto my SGI in 1998.

    and so i went looking up references to "Pieter Hintjens" on altavista.
    and i found: http://pw1.netcom.com/~jcds/docs/Review_htmlpp.html
    "Pieter Hintjens' HTML Pre-Processor HTMLPP"

    some more background about me...

    in the early 90's until early 1995, i slaved on the Purdue University
    campus (west lafayette, indiana, usa) at silly DOS applications.  in
    late 93/early 94, i witnessed the birth of this web thing and started my
    own web server..  and taught myself CGI... and immediately recognized the
    need for the "define once, include everywhere" philosophy of website
    authoring.  in fact, the software which i started writing in 1994 to
    address that (i called HTDB for HyperText DataBase) has now matured into
    a semi-commercial product: http://www.adjective.com/htdb.html

    another tie-in?  i don't know if you were responsible at all for the
    http://pw1.netcom.com/~jcds/docs/Review_htmlpp.html site, but i was
    webmaster at NETCOM for awhile - it was my efforts which allowed pages
    such as the above to even exist!

    that said..

    i will be playing with the xitami server.  i would be particularly
    interested in learning more of the Libero language/method and how it
    might assist in web application writing.  i've my own ideas (using HTDB)
    of introducing "stateful-ness" into the web app world, and am interested
    to see how you approach it.  at this point, it would not suprise me to
    find they are similar!

    good evening from san francisco!

    pieter replies: hi, san francisco!  by an amazing coincidence (ok, i did

    hear from someone who can still write coherently with a mind that is
    twisted inside out.  i tried that once and it did not do my programming
    any good at all.  here at imatix we have our own urban legend, about a
    programmer who, smashed on a friday evening, spent all weekend writing a
    fantastic new tool.  on monday morning he showed it to his colleagues,
    who all agreed that it looked really amazing, and asked what it did.
    'not sure', he said.  no-one ever really got it to work, and sometimes
    people still whisper its name, late at night, to scare the junior techs.
    the motto is: most of the software out there must have been written by
    the same guy.  hey, microsoft, stay away from the hard stuff!


 == FOCUS ON TECHNOLOGY -..-..--..-..--..-..--.--.--.--.--.-..-...-.--...-.--

    GSL - a Generic Schema Language based on XML

    A critical part of the iMatix mission is code generation.  We use this
    technique in Libero to generate code from templates, called 'schemas',
    in a variety of languages.

    There are many tools which generate code, but the vast majority use
    built-in code templates.  Even those which let you tune the generated
    code by editing an external file are still totally dedicated to one
    task.

    Code generation (as we use it in iMatix) means taking a data definition
    (for instance, a Libero dialog), and a schema file (for instance, a
    schema for generating Perl).  The code generator combines these two
    files and produces a resulting block of compilable code in Perl.

    Code generation is an economic way to turn-out large numbers of nearly-
    identical source code files - it's simply easier to specify the
    differences between each instance, and a 'standard model', than to build
    each instance from scratch by hand.  Once you've started using a code
    generator, you can maintain your work as easily as changing the
    'standard model' (your schema) and regenerating.  Not only is code
    generation cheap, it can also result in excellent code, since it's
    economical to spend a lot of effort tuning and improving the schemas.
    Lastly, code generation is a good way to make applications more
    portable.  

    These are some classic uses for code generation:
        Database management
            - The object defines a database table
            - Generates copy books, header files, subroutines, SQL
            - E.g. data dictionaries
        Message handling
            - Object defines a structured message
            - Generates pack/unpack functions
            - E.g. XDR (rfc1014, rfc1832)
        Flow control
            - Object defines program logic flow
            - Generates interpreter for logic flow
            - E.g. Lex, Yacc, Libero

    So why don't people use code generators a lot more?  The answer is that
    it takes a lot of work to make a decent code generator, and you'll find
    yourself writing new generators for each new problem you come across.
    
    The iMatix notion of a schema was invented in 1986 by Leif Svalgaard,
    working at Sobemap in Brussels, Belgium.  At the time, the few that could
    generate code used built-in code strings, e.g.:

        print "<HTML><P>", var, "</HTML>";

    Leif conceived the 'schema' as an external text file that held the code
    strings to output for the generated code.  The concept evolved for many
    years, and was used in over a dozen different code generators.  In 1992,
    the Libero tool introduced multilanguage schemas, making it possible to
    generate code in any programming language (C, Java, VB, Cobol,...), but 
    the process was still constrained by code generator.  Libero can only
    generate code for one type of object - the dialog definition.

    A schema is a schema is a source code template, a text file that looks
    like the language it wants to generate: C, Cobol, SQL, whatever.  A
    schema is half-script, and half-source code.  It's written by experts in
    the domain, and maintained by competent users.  Schemas are often
    customised per project, according to site, platform, or personal needs.

    Sometime early this year, we experimented with using XML as the basis
    for defining objects.  If you're not aware of XML, it is a way to
    represent any kind of data object with multiple levels of data.  An XML
    file is self-describing, can be validated, and can be parsed by a
    generic parser.  XML allows ad-hoc mark-up languages.  It is portable,
    standard, simple, modern, and born from the Internet and the Web.  It's
    also really, really useful for code generation.

    For instance, I can easily recode a Libero dialog as an XML file.  This
    is the start of the Libero 'lrcode' dialog, which parses a dialog file:

    After-Init:
        (--) Ok                                 -> Expect-State-Name
              + Open-Dialog-File
              + Expect-State-Name
              + Get-Next-Token

    Expect-State-Name:
        (--) State-Name                         -> After-State
              + Attach-New-State
              + Expect-State-Definition
              + Get-Next-Token
        (--) Item-Name                          -> After-State
              + Warning-On-State-Name
              + Attach-New-State
              + Expect-State-Definition
              + Get-Next-Token

    Now I'll recode this as XML:

    <DIALOG>
    <STATE name="After-Init">
      <EVENT name="Ok" NextState="Expect-State-Name">
        <MODULE name=" Open-Dialog-File
        <MODULE name=" Expect-State-Name
        <MODULE name=" Get-Next-Token
      </EVENT>
    </STATE>
    <STATE name="Expect-State-Name:
      <EVENT name="State-Name" next="After-State">
        <MODULE name="Attach-New-State" />
        <MODULE name="Expect-State-Definition" />
        <MODULE name="Get-Next-Token" />
      </EVENT>
      <EVENT name="Item-Name" next="After-State">
        <MODULE name="Warning-On-State-Name" />
        <MODULE name="Attach-New-State" />
        <MODULE name="Expect-State-Definition" />
        <MODULE name="Get-Next-Token" />
      </EVENT>
    </STATE>

    Now let's look at a GSL fragment which prints this as a Libero dialog:

    .open "lrcode.l"
    .for state
    $(Name):
    .  for event
    .   (--) $(Name)                            -> $(Next)
    .    for module
    .         + $(Name)
    .    endfor
    .  endfor
    .endfor
    
    GSL is the Generic Schema Language.  It's a simple scripting language
    with special constructs for code generation.  GSL uses a single format
    for input data definitions - XML, and can generate code in any language,
    like Libero.  The first GSL implementation was a Perl program, but the
    current GSL code generator is a fast, portable package written in C.

    You can use GSL for classic code generation: define your application
    objects as XML, and write schemas to generate SQL definitions,
    data access routines, messages, forms, programs.  This is how the iMatix
    Studio Workbench (yes, still being developed) will work.  The GSL code
    generator can be embedded in other tools, since it's available both as a
    command-line utility and a callable subroutine.
    
    You can use GSL to build interfaces.  Define the import/export format as
    an XML language, and use GSL scripts to validate exchange files, to
    manipulate them, and to convert them to further formats.  The iMatix SFL
    contains a module (sflxml) which will read and write XML data files.

    You can even use GSL for end-user applications, such as report
    generation, database administration, and preparing junk emails.  If you
    can get the data into XML, you can generate source code, or text files
    from it using GSL.
    
    The GSL code generators will not be provided as open source software,
    but will be available as free trial versions for certain platforms, from
    January 1999.  The price for the commercial GSL code generator will be
    around US$1000.
    

 == TERMINATE THE PROGRAM -...---...-..----....-.---..---...-...---.-...---.-

    We'd like to apologise for the scarcity of jokes this month.  Someone
    crashed our jokes server by trying to load another set of iyfeg jokes
    onto it.  Unfortunately this overloaded the bogusity relays, and the
    hard drive jumped its spindle.  True fact: in the days when hard drives
    were measured in square meters, one of the deadly hazards of working
    with computers was the risk that a hard drive would jump its spindle.
    You do not want to be in the way of a 50-kilo steel disc spinning at
    a thousand revolutions per minute.  In our case, the jokes server hard
    disk managed to slash its way through a stale cheese sandwich, a bag of
    'cheeso-snaps' and one pizza, before falling to the floor.  They don't
    make 'em like they used to.

    To get off the Liberetto mailing list, just reply with 'remove' in the
    subject.
