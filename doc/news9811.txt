 == COMMENT ---...-.-...-.--...-.--...-.-...-.....---..-....--.--..-.-.---.--

    The software industry appears to be obsessed by the question: Who can
    compete with Microsoft?  It's an issue that is shaping the business, so
    perhaps the obsession is normal.  Often the issue is presented as Good
    vs. Evil, but this is the recourse of the desperate.  It's not about one
    company making better products than another, having a higher moral status
    than another, or being better' than another.  It's simply about survival
    in a pond where the big fish is *really* big.

    We've seen a number of anti-Microsoft strategies come and go.  Generally,
    Microsoft attacks a market head-on, with flashy products, free giveaways,
    and lots of publicity.  The full-frontal defense tried by WordPerfect,
    Borland, Novell, Netscape, and other ex-market leaders does not work,
    and can in fact ruin a company: aquisitions and marketing campaigns can
    be hideously costly.

    Sun has tried a double strategy.  As far as regards its Unix systems, it
    ignores Microsoft.  It also seems to ignore its clients, and now sells
    systems that are comparatively expensive and limited.  We've ported our
    software to dozens of Unix systems, and the biggest problems have always
    been on Sun systems.  Sun's second approach has been to push new
    technologies like Java.  Java was intended to be a Microsoft killer, but
    like I said, the direct approach does not seem to work well against the
    chaps in Redmond.
    
    IBM and Oracle have done much better: aim for the corporate dollars by
    offering products and services that are reassuringly expensive, complex,
    and reliable.  After all, Windows NT with SQL Server can't compete
    against a serious Unix system running DB2 or Oracle, can it?  Right.

    Then there are the 'stealth' companies like Corel, who by re-inventing
    themselves continuously can keep finding and supplying new markets.
    It's a neat trick, which relies on the fact that there is always a
    window of a few years before Microsoft can get its act together in a new
    domain.  But it only works with smaller companies who have strong
    leaders.

    The current darling of those who would topple Bill Gates is a cuddly
    penguin called 'Tux' who symbolises the Linux movement.  But Linux is
    not a competitor to Microsoft.  Linux is like the Internet.  It's an
    open technology, indestructible, and plastic enough to be moulded into
    any form.  Little network clients, giant server clusters.  It runs on
    every modern CPU worthwhile: in fact its true value is its portabilty.
    Install Linux today on an Intel, move everything tomorrow to an Alpha
    or Sparc.
    
    Microsoft will start by ignoring Linux, and then when Linux has 30% of
    the market, they will denounce it.  Eventually, they will incorporate
    Linux into their product range, and then try to take it over.  Imagine
    a MS Linux distribution.  It will happen.  Maybe it already exists...

    One final approach is to compete by exploiting Microsoft's own
    weaknesses, which are many, and well-known.  MS cannot write decent
    code.  Their applications are huge, slow, and way too complex.  The
    sticky web of DLLs means that upgrading one part of a Windows system
    often spills-over into service patches, and fixpacks.  The more MS
    integrates applications like MSIE into their operating systems, the
    worse it gets.
    
    Most people who use Xitami do so because it's so small and easy,
    compared to Microsoft's servers.  Xitami is just well-written.  We only
    shine because the alternatives are so bad.

    We're not afraid to compete with Microsoft.  In fact, it's rather fun.

    In the docs for Libero it says ...
    
    "Working With Java - the README.DOC file included in the beta kit
    explains how to develop Java programs using Libero."
    
    I have not been able to find that README.DOC in the windows zip files
    that I downloaded --- lrmswin.zip, lrmswins.zip and lrwinsrc.zip.
    
    Any experience using Libero Java code with VisualCafe development toolkit?
    Basically I'm just looking for any info that will help on the Java side
    when using Libero.
    
    I note that there have been no releases since June 1997 ... so good it
    never has bugs or little time to update?
    
    Many thanks,
    Bob.

    Libero is perfect, naturally. :)  The documentation does have a few
    errors, such as the one you pointed out.  The Java schemas have been a
    standard part of Libero for yonks, and the Libero doc. has an entire
    section on using Java (small, but entire).
    
    Libero has been well used for a long time and this incarnation has few or
    no bugs.  Our long term plans call for replacing the Libero code
    generator by a more generic tool which uses XML files instead of
    Libero's native dialog files.  We'd also like to junk the Windows GUI,
    and provide a web-based interface.  There are good reasons for this, not
    least the ability to edit dialogs from a distance, something that's
    essential for teams of developers.

    Subject:        	BUG in exdr_read?
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Hi,

    I just started using your SFL/SMT libraries a few weeks ago, and so
    far I'm quite pleased with them!  They're a great set of development
    libraries. However, I was just digging through your memory transaction
    routines and looked at exdr_read() as an example of how to use them.
    Please correct me if I'm wrong, but there seems to be a potentially
    dangerous problem with the way this function uses the memory
    transactions.

    At the top, it starts a transaction with mem_new_trans(), and if a
    mem_alloc() call fails, it properly does a mem_rollback() to free all
    allocated blocks since the beginning of the transaction.  However, upon
    successful completion, it never calls mem_commit().  According to the
    documentation for the mem_rollback() function:

    "... if you forget to do a mem commit(), a later mem rollback() will do
    damage to your memory space."

    So, should I be concerned?  Even if subsequent rollbacks won't do damage
    as this would lead me to believe, won't there be a "memory leak" type
    situation with repeated calls of exdr_read()?  Since no mem_commit() is
    called, the transaction record in mem_rollback() will never be freed,
    and memory will be slowly eaten up, never to be recovered until the
    program ends.

    Please let me know your thoughts on this.  I'm thinking of fixing
    exdr_read() myself so I feel safer about my project.

    Thanks,
    Mark Blythe 

    >>>>>>>>>>>>>
    Indeed, if one creates memory transactions without ever committing them,
    your memory will get eaten up.  One good way to detect this is to use the
    mem_assert() macro at the normal end of a program.  In this specific
    case, you either misread sflexdr.c, or have a modified copy.  The
    released source always does mem_rollback() or mem_commit() before it
    returns.

    Great website; I have one question:  how do you make money? Your suffix
    is .com, not .org, so I assume you are not non-profit (like, say, the
    Free Software Foundation). Do you sell other products?
    -Dave

    >>>>>>>>>>>>>
    Who says we make money?  :-)  We make software.  Okay, this is one of
    the questions that has to go into the Great iMatix FAQ, along with 'how
    do you pronouce iMatix,' and 'Why did you not add garlic to the humus
    recipe'.  iMatix consists of three branches.  The consultancy branch
    provides highly-paid and highly-skilled technical assistance to various
    large and critical projects.  This we do locally in various countries,
    and occasionally for remote clients by e-mail.  In this branch, we often
    develop specific interfaces, servers, and other software.  Our second
    branch does pure research and development, and is financed by the first.
    Our R&D is tightly focussed, since we have a Mission, and we know where
    we want to arrive.  Currently we're working on our top-end Studio
    product, which will be a sophisticated web-based environment for
    building web-based applications.  Our third branch produces the software
    that we distribute, for free or for sale.  Currently, this mainly means
    Xitami.  This branch is supposed to be self-financing through the sale
    of support licenses and commercial products like Xitami/Pro.

    Occasionally, the Liberetto office has guests.  The careful ones beat a
    hasty retreat when they hear the strange noises coming from the coke
    machine, but a few of the hardy souls actually make it to 'Ed's' office,
    and some of these even survive the coffee.

    One such last month was our friend Darius, from Phidani, a Belgian
    company which does parsers.  This is understating it a little.  Phidani
    makes parsers like BMW makes cars.  So, I was quite interested when
    Darius told me of his new tool, 'RainCode', which does interesting
    things with legacy Cobol code.  We see a lot of this in the various
    projects we work on.  A tool like RainCode lets us do useful stuff with
    it, apart from just complaining about the poor guys who wrote it.

    Anyhow, while legacy Cobol code is not directly part of the iMatix
    mission, I'm glad to be able to present RainCode, in the words of
    Darius.  Enjoy!

    ----------------------------------------    
    RainCode, complianceware - Managing your source code real-estate

    Before being a problem, a market, an opportunity or the latest
    buzzword for Y2K marketing people, legacy happens to be made of
    lots of code.  Except in rare cases - up to a point where I have
    never heard of a single one - anything like reliable design
    information or beyond the trivial inter-module dependency information
    is lost.  Or awfully obsolete, which is perhaps even worse.

    The only thing we know for sure about the code is its executability.
    It executes.  If it did not, we would notice instantly.  That's one of 
    the nice side-effects of using compilers.

    Executability is of course a significant part of the story, but it
    is far from being enough.  We need the ability to find, measure and
    detect things far beyond what a compiler can handle:

    - Is our source compliant to our internal coding standards?  More
      importantly, what about the source code provided by sub-contractors 
      or updated by consultants?
      
    - Given a change of platform, database, version of compiler, how many
      alterations to the code should we perform?
      
    - Producing structured documentation charts, version XREFs, etc...
    
    - Reverse-engineering some design information out of the code.

    Besides, in many large scale projects that do live for more than
    2 or 3 years, systematic and repetitive changes must be applied
    at least once, to adapt to a new computing environment, file 
    structure, taking advantage of new features, or even, to reflect 
    a significant change in functionality.

    This is where RainCode gets into the picture.  RainCode analyses
    your COBOL source code, builds a parse tree, and gives you full
    access to this parse tree using a concise and powerful ad hoc 
    scripting language. You can detect structures, statements, usages
    that do not conform to your standards, unreferenced data, etc...

    Even more, after finding things in the source code, RainCode can
    then perform patches as well, thereby automating some tedious
    adaptative coding tasks, some of which are not trivial by any mean. 
    For instance, http://www.etk.com/download/etkpak/style.txt describes 
    how a COBOL program should be a depth-first flattening of its tree
    structure. A RainCode script that takes a COBOL program, and makes it 
    compliant to this rule would be about 50 to 70 lines long. 

    Together with Amdahl Belgium, we have just completed a project aimed at
    taking a number of COBOL transactions, removing the presentation part
    of them, and turning them into business logic transactions callable
    from a Transaction Server (MSTS).  The COBOL code manipulation is
    entirely automated using RainCode.

    There are zillions of possible applications, and that's probably what
    makes RainCode unique.  Y2K tools aim at a single kind of source code
    manipulation. RainCode can perform any source code manipulation,
    dealing with problems so obscure and so specific that no specific
    product will do the job.

    RainCode is available for COBOL, and a C++ version will be available 
    Q1'99.  It runs under NT and various flavours of Unix.

    Further information is available at http://www.raincode.com, including
    a full on-line technical information, as well as a downloadable
    postscript image of the user-manual.

    The American Bar Association's Law Practive Management Magazine reviewed
    Xitami in their October issue.  The full text is at the abanet.org site
    at http://www.abanet.org/lpm/magazine/tu987.html.  This is how it starts:

    "Wow."

    This is how it continues:
    
     "It's been years since I've seen a product that even registers on the
    Wow Scale. (Jaded? Me?)  But the Xitami Web server is just plain
    astonishing...  Let's see. Fast, easy, well-documented, runs on 95, NT,
    Unix, OS/2,  OpenVMS, and Windows 3.x. Yeesh. Something that fancy is
    probably enormous. It's gotta be a hundred Mbytes or so. Yes? Nope. 618K.

    And finally:
    
    "I'm impressed. 618 K; it's free; it's fast; and in about 20 minutes,
    I've gone from no server to Web server -- with enough time left over to
    wander around and say "Wow" more times than an alpha-geek wannabe would
    ordinarily admit to. Bill Gates, eat your heart out.  At this writing,
    Xitami is the single most popular download from ServerWatch."

    Now we'll have to delete the lawyer jokes from the iMatix intranet.

    
 == TERMINATE THE PROGRAM -...---...-..----....-.---..---...-...---.-...---.-

    In Belgium, recently, there was a report telling how road accidents had
    increased by 30% over the same period last year (Jan-Jun).  The people
    who compiled the report attributed this variously to bad driving, more
    cars on the road, and the bad weather (i.e. El Nino, once again).  Of
    course the main reason was that all those drivers didn't read Liberetto.
    It could also be linked to the explosion in GSM phones, but who knows?

    Anyway, to cut a long story short, if you really don't want to get more
    of these mails, just let us know.  We can take it.
