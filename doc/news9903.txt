 == COMMENT ---...-.-...-.--...-.--...-.-...-.....---..-....--.--..-.-.---.--

    This month I'm looking at a new twist on the upcoming Y2K problem.  Of
    course everyone now knows the problem: on 1 January 2000 (or 4 January
    for those coming back from the party), our computer systems will start
    to fail in subtle and less subtle ways.  This will be bad news.

    Since this problem crossed the public awareness horizon in 1997 or so,
    the brightest and bestest have tried to find the holy grail: a simple,
    general-purpose solution to what is, after all, a very small problem (2
    bytes large, in most cases).  Every few months, another genius writes to
    the papers saying they've found a miracle cure (like stuffing eight
    digits into the space used by six).  People snigger a little, then get
    back to the problem.

    In fact, all people working on the Y2K problem are taking a similar
    approach (apart from the essential activities of trying to find another
    job, preferrably in another industry, and failing that, to figure-out
    who will get the blame in 2000).  In January 2000, computers will stop
    working the way they should, and the basic approach is to try to fix
    this.

    I'm convinced that this approach will fail - it's too late, too costly,
    and frankly, way too boring.  Who wants to work through several zillion
    lines of undocumented COBOL code when they could be playing Lara Croft?

    So, in an innovative stroke of genius, the iMatix Research Labs have
    thought-up an approach that is cheap, easy, and above all, feasible.  We
    call this the Y2K Vaccination Programme, or Y2KVP.  Unlike the standard
    strategy of trying to fix a lot of lousy code, the Y2KVP actually makes
    use of the principal feature of most software - its total lack of quality.

    Y2KVP came out of discussions we had with a client.  This company has a
    central computer system that is so bad it's frankly amazing.  When the
    system crashed, no-one noticed for two days.  The users of this system
    could typically get one day's use out of the system every week.  For the
    rest, they had ferretted-out the data they needed to do their work,
    keeping it on paper, diskettes, or small databases on their PCs.

    Now, the idea was of course to fix this horrible computer system.  But,
    wait a minute... this system, horrible as it is, has no Y2K problem.  It
    already runs so badly that even a total Y2K wipeout would probably pass
    by unnoticed.  To  put it another way, the users of this system have
    already developed Y2K immunity!  Repeated injections of semi-fatal
    computer crashes had caused the users to develop full resistance to the
    real thing.  So, to make Y2KVP work, all we need to do is degrade the
    quality of computer systems, instead of trying to improve them.  Users
    will complain of course (no-one likes to get needled) but within six
    months at most, they'll be quite used to working without their computers
    and networks for long periods.

    I'll give you an example of how Y2KVP works.  Up to a week ago, I used a
    dual boot NT/Win95 PC, plus a Win95 notebook.  Both essential for my work.
    Then in the space of one long weekend, I discovered that the Win95
    'Restart in DOS mode' option will actually wipe-out the NT boot sector
    (okay, two days down to reinstall Windows NT).  Then my Win95 notebook
    died with a corrupted hard disk, which Windows 95 converted into five
    thousand files called FILE0001.CHK, FILE0002.CHK, etc.  I thought I was
    totally reliant on these systems, but now I could easily weather a Y2K
    crash with a defiant laugh.  Hah!  (By the way, those of you who
    wondered why I was not replying to e-mail, now you know...  I'm still a
    bit dopey from the tranquilisers)

    Generously, we've decided to place Y2KVP into the public domain, and
    we've been planning how to put it into practice.  Ideally, we'd like a
    central computer operating system that is unstable and encourages users
    to fall back on their PCs.  Then, we'll cleverly choose a PC operating
    system that crashes easily, looses data, and thus innoculates its users
    to the point where a week or two of downtime on January 2000 will not be
    noticed.  Some major software companies are releasing beta versions of
    new OSes that will perform perfectly here.

    Of course, the press will have to cooperate, to end the current fashion
    for high-quality systems like Linux.  People simply do not realise how
    dangerous it can be to install Linux on a PC!!  This is not the moment
    to lower the immunity level of the computer user population.

    Luckily, it appears that the software industry has been working in this
    way for years, and the majority of software is fully Y2KVP compatible.
    
    Y2KVP is perhaps the best chance we have of averting disaster, if we act
    now!

    When can we expect to see an XML driven Liberetto ?
    John Totten

    >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
    Ah, yes.  Few people know this, but XML is actually based on an earlier
    language, SGLML, which stands for 'Standardised General Liberetto Markup
    Language'.  SGLML is so sophisticated that not a single fully compliant
    compiler has ever been constructed.  In fact, it's been mathematically
    proven that this would require the combined mental effort of every civil
    servant in the world for at least ten years (roughly five point three
    iotas).  Even our janitor, Harry, was unable to contruct a fully
    normalised non-backtracking LR(1) grammer for SGLML.  We rest out case.

    To all at iMatix and whoever (is it only Pieter?) is responsible 
    for Xitami:
    Your stuff is great !!
    I am forced to use several diffent webservers for my clients from 
    NES to Apache to JWS, but Xitami is my primary testbed and the 
    most fun to work with. Unfortunately, for some of the real high-
    powered eCommerce sites that I work on, the client would never 
    consider it. But I am turning as many on to it as will listen.
    However, as impressed as I am with Xitami, I am even MORE interested 
    in GSLgen. As soon as I master the evaluation kit (and assuming it 
    even comes close to the high standards and expectations set by 
    Xitami), you can expect a PRO license application from us in the 
    near future.
    I applaud what you are doing and would love to meet y'all some 
    day.
    Thanx.

    Subject:        	Technical question about Libero
    From:           	Brad Dixon <brad.dixon@gtri.gatech.edu>
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Hello,
    I am considering using Libero for a project analyzing data from an
    avionics system. The user of our system will construct simple state
    machines using Libero to analyze a stream of data. I'm having trouble
    understanding how to have multiple simple state machines using the same
    set of input events. The following simple example should illustrate my
    problem:
    Example data stream:

    MARYHADALITTLELAMB

    Our user wishes to find two patterns:
    	a) "TT" followed by an "A"
    	b) "LI" followed by a "L" and then a "B"
    From the sample data stream you can see that pattern A and B overlap. It
    is certainly possible to construct one state machine to find either
    pattern in the data stream but it is easier to visualize and construct the
    problem as two seperate state machines.
    Our target language is Perl.
    Q: Have any you heard of any other similar applications? How did they
    handle this situation.
    My current idea is to create a new schema that will create a Perl module.
    I can then use multiple perl modules in my application and feed them
    events via a method call.
    I would appreciate any suggestions that you may have.
    Thanks,

    >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
    As far as I understand your question, you'd like to pass the input to
    multiple FSMs in parallel, to analyse ambigous input without backtracking. 

    This is an interesting problem. Perl is perhaps not the ideal language
    (slow, when you start to do serious computations), but that's a detail.

    We've used Libero to do parallel FSMs in various projects. The principle is
    quite simple. You construct event queues, and write the schema to take
    events from the queue. You can create 'instances' or threads simply by
    saving the FSM state variables (state, module, event, and event queue) and
    doing a context switch before invoking each FSM module. You can also pass
    this state information as an argument to the code. The SMT kernel does this
    kind of thing, although the objectives are different.

    Libero is well suited to doing this kind of thing, since you can play with
    the schema as needed to construct your own FSM model.
