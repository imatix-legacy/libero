 == COMMENT ---...-.-...-.--...-.--...-.-...-.....---..-....--.--..-.-.---.--

    From time to time I have the pleasure to be asked to help with a project
    in some far corner of the world.  In September I went to the Ile de la
    Reunion, a small part of France stuck out in the Indian Ocean between
    Madagascar and Mauritius.  Reunion is definitely worth visiting, for the
    climate, the landscape, the food, and above all for the Creole people.

    But this is not a travel guide. The project involved networking about a
    hundred people to a Unix system.  Half used normal PCs, and half used
    a small device that will certainly become more and more popular in the
    next century.  It looks like a black modem, and stands on its side or
    lies flat.  You plug-in a SVGA screen, keyboard, mouse, and network
    cable, and switch it on.  In a half a minute, you are connected to the
    X server running on the Unix.  X is a protocol that provides you with a
    graphical terminal.
    
    This is all old news to those who have used computers in universities,
    where X workstations have been used for many years.  The interesting
    thing in this site was that these cute little X stations were being
    installed to run nothing more fancy than an accounting system.

    The second interesting thing about this project was that the X stations
    would also run Netscape Navigator, and through that, allow users to read
    their e-mail, run Lotus Notes applications, browse the intranet, and
    eventually the Internet.  For the price of some add-on software, a big
    NT server, and an (unused) NT Workstation license per user, these X
    stations will also run the Citrix Winframe emulator, and through that,
    Windows applications.

    So, we have a little box which costs less than a PC, cannot catch a
    virus, has no registry, and no DLLs.  It does not crash, and can be
    replaced from stock in minutes.  It lets you do everything you do now,
    and will never be outdated.  Your main additional cost is the Unix
    server, which could be a Linux system.

    The only drawback that I can see is that you can't take your work home
    with you or, as do I did: pack it into your hand baggage and take it
    with me to the Ile de la Reunion.

    The future of office computing belongs to the servers, terminals, and 
    portables.  The 'standard PC' is history.  Anyone want to buy mine?

 == FOCUS ON TECHNOLOGY -..-..--..-..--..-..--.--.--.--.--.-..-...-.--...-.--

    Our subject this month... memory.  More specifically, how to stop it
    from leaking.  Yes, if you suffer from wet chips, this article is the
    one you've been waiting for!

    A 'memory leak' is actually a programming bug.  Most languages, like C,
    let you allocate chunks of memory for all kinds of reasons, and some
    languages, like C++, do this almost instinctively.  Before a C++
    program can tie its shoelaces, it can already allocate more memory
    than you need to feed a family of Eniacs.  *Really* modern languages,
    like Java, do away with this kind of business, and one day may even be
    as safe and robust as COBOL.  In my day, we didn't 'ave any of them
    seedy roms, it were all fed in on paper tape...

    Anyhow, a nice C program is full of nice little bugs, and one of the
    nicest kind is the memory leak.  Our talented and enthusiastic programmer
    has understood the 'malloc' function and now uses it to build strings,
    arrays, lists, and entire virtual cathedrals.  The proper thing to do is
    to use the 'free' function to return the memory once it's no longer
    needed.  But when a program ends, this happens automatically, so most
    programmers don't get into the habit of using free.

    The consequence of doing malloc's without matching free's is that when
    you use the program for a while, it simply swallows more and more memory
    until it's so fat it explodes, a bit like the guy in Monty Python's "The
    Meaning of Life".  This rude enough for a word processor, but it's very
    bad manners indeed for a program like Xitami which has to run day and
    night.

    The iMatix SFL library contains a module, sflmem.  If you compare the
    enthusiastic programmer to a kid checking-out books from a library
    without ever returning them, then sflmem is the librarian who gives him
    nightmares.

    Sflmem keeps track of every malloc and every free.  When the program
    (eventually) ends, sflmem checks that every malloc was nicely freed.
    If it finds one that was not, it shows a polite but stern message and
    aborts the program.  The program was ending anyhow, so the abort is a
    bit redundant, but it's sflmem's way of making a point.

    How do we use this to make Xitami more robust?  First, we use sflmem's
    functions for all malloc's and free's.  Then, when Xitami ends, it calls
    the sflmem 'mem_assert' function, which does the check and eventual
    abort.  We fire-up Xitami, run tests on it, then end it.  If any memory
    was left unfreed, we get the nasty message, and a trace file that shows
    where the original 'malloc' was.
    
    We've used this technique in all our software since the SFL project was
    started, and it works well.  Not that we're about to boast, but it does
    make our software more reliable and stable.

    Subject:    Schema for OPL (Psion handhelds language)
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Hi,
    I notice that you have a number of schemas for various languages.
    How difficult would it be to add support for OPL, the language used
    in EPOC32 based handheld machines? (these include the Psion range
    and the Geofox one).  I think there would be a large take up by the
    enthusiastic OPL developers out there.  The specs and SDK are all
    freely available...  SDK from: http://developer.epocworld.com/
    Language guide/ref manual from:http://www.psion.com/downloads/docs/opl/
    Many thanks for making Libero...  I am trying hard with the REXX
    schema, and almost made my brain understand the concept!

    So what can we look forward to with XML and Libero 3.x ?
    -- JohnT


    Pieter Hintjens replies: Nothing specific yet.  We're building this up
    slowly. The main things will be:
    - Dialogs stored as XML files instead or as an alternative to the .l
      format.  This will make it possible to use the many current and future
      tools which accept, edit, or manipulate XML, including future browsers.
    - A new code generator, based on an XML-driven system we're developing
      today.  We are looking at allowing XML trees to be derived by
      inheritance from other trees, which means that dialogs could be based
      on other dialogs, adding or replacing actions, events, and states.
    - A web-based dialog editor, part of our web-based development environment,
      iMatix Studio.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Dear iMatix,
    Please add me to the Liberetto distribution list.  I have recently
    downloaded Libero v2.30, and I think that it is a great programming
    tool.  I had no previous experience with the concept of state machines,
    so it took me a couple of days to get the hang of things.  I was
    able to turn my first dialog into Visual Basic code and step through
    the program as it was running using MS-Access.  I found this to be
    very useful in order to figure out the relationships between states,
    events, and modules.  I then took the same dialog and turned it into
    a COBOL program, which I was able to upload to the mainframe and
    compile cleanly on the first try.  Very cool!!

    On a slightly more disturbing note, I noticed that the following
    warning sign had recently been posted on the Coke machine at our
    office:

      "DO NOT TIP OR ROCK THIS VENDING MACHINE.  TIPPING
         OR ROCKING MAY CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH"

    When I saw this sign, I immediately ran back to my desk and re-read
    your Coke machine example dialog.  I did not find any references to
    this sort of psychopathic behaviour.  Is this particular Coke machine
    an isolated case, or are you aware of an increasing trend towards
    violence in Coke machines in general?  If this is the case, I think
    that your example dialog should be updated.  I took a crack at this
    myself as a practice exercise: 

    Should-Be-Gently-Humming:
        (--) Ok                                 -> Something-Happened
              + Wait-For-A-Punter
        (--) Dead                               -> 
              + Stop-The-Programme

    Something-Happened:
        (--) Clink                              -> Before-Cooperating
              + Accept-Punters-Cash
              + Wait-For-Punters-Choice
              + Shall-We-Cooperate

              + Determine-Punters-Fate
        (--) Clunk                              -> 
              + Exit-Stage-Left-Running
              + Stop-The-Programme

    Attack-Punter:
        (--) Intimidate                         -> Something-Happened
              + Scare-Punter-Away
              + Wait-For-A-Punter
        (--) Maim                               -> Something-Happened

        (--) Kill                               -> Something-Happened
              + Kill-Punter
              + Wait-For-A-Punter

    I'm still pretty new at this, so any suggestions for improvement
    are most welcome.  Thanks for Libero!

    Subject:    htmlpp in LJ
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Hi!
    I discovered your html pre-processor courtesy of your article in the
    December 1997 issue of Linux Journal (I've a bit of a backlog in my
    reading... :-). It sounded like something I could use, so I downloaded
    it and have been playing with it ever since.  Very useful; I've used it
    to convert some reports at work from Word to a useful HTML format (Word
    97's auto-convert produces truly awful HTML), and on my personal web
    pages.  [http://www.pipeline.com/~cyhiggin] 

    No, I haven't used it to produce all of my pages, but I did use it to
    overhaul some of my mud-related pages. Two problems your program proved
    very useful in solving: (1) standard headers & footers with navbars on
    each page, and (2) creating Lynx-compatible tables.  #2 required a bit
    of macro programming, and I still didn't get it as automatic as I would
    have liked--I still don't understand the macro-expansion and when to
    escape characters and when not to in Perl as well as I should -- but it
    works. TIMTOWTDI.

    One of these days I'll learn enough Perl to write a Perl script to
    auto-convert existing small tables to Lynx-friendly tables. It would be
    a good learning project, I think.

    BTW, the Linux Journal article was a very good tutorial on how to use
    htmlpp. You should put an html version of it on your website, and pack it
    with your htmlpp distribution, to complement the htmlpp reference you do
    include in your docs.

    Thank you for a really useful program.
